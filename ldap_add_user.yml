#
# This playbook creates or modifies an LDAP account based on the attributes given to the prompts below. This should be
# run only by a sysadmin, as they would be the only ones who could create a new entry or modify an existing entry in
# the LDAP hierarchy. This should not be used as a password-change script. However, this _can_ be used to grant
# membership into application groups by including an application server in the inventory that is passed.
